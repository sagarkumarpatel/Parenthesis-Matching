# Parenthesis-Matching
This C program checks for balanced parentheses in an expression using a stack. It pushes opening brackets (`(`, `{`, `[`) and pops them when matching closing brackets are found. If the stack is empty at the end, the parentheses are balanced. Demonstrates stack operations, memory management, and efficient problem-solving.
